                </li>
              <li>Make in-person interactions a priority. Although online communication is practical, nothing can take the place of in-person discussions. Allow time for offline interactions.</li>
              <li><strong>Communicate Openly:</strong>Take care of issues before they get out of hand. Misunderstandings can be avoided by having constructive conversations about social media use.</li>
              <li><strong>Practice Digital Detox: </strong>Taking pauses from social media can help you avoid online distractions and refocus on relationships in the real world.</li>
            </ul><br>
 
          <h2>In conclusion</h2>
          <p>Although social media is an effective way to stay in touch with loved ones, real human interaction should always be complemented by it rather than replaced. We can better manage relationships in the digital age by establishing limits, encouraging communication, and striking a balance between our online and offline lives.</p>
